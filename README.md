## Implement a design with bootstrap

In this project, I implement 3 web pages with Bootstrap. I use all HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design/Bootstrap knowledges that you learned previously.

I donâ€™t have a lot of instruction, I'm free to implement it the way that I want - the objective is simple: Have fully functional web pages that look the same as the designer file.

Here the final result:
